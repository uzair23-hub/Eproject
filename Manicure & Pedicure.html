                    <br>

                <p>An Acrylic Pedicure is an advanced and durable pedicure treatment that focuses on enhancing the appearance of your toenails with acrylic nails. This pedicure is ideal for individuals looking to correct nail imperfections, add length, or achieve a flawless, long-lasting finish. Acrylic nails are applied to the natural toenails using a combination of liquid monomer and powder polymer, creating a strong and flexible coating that can last for weeks.</p>

                    <b>Step-by-Step Process:</b>
                    <br>
                    Soaking & Cleaning:
                    <br>
                    Your feet are first soaked in warm, soothing water to soften the skin and nails. Any dirt or debris is gently removed, and the nails are cleaned thoroughly.
                    <br>
                    Exfoliation:
                    <br>
                    Exfoliation is performed on the feet to remove dead skin and calluses, leaving the feet feeling soft and smooth.
                    <br>
                    Cuticle Care:
                    <br>
                    The cuticles are pushed back and trimmed to ensure clean nail beds, allowing for better adhesion of the acrylic nails.
                    <br>
                    Acrylic Nail Application:
                    <br>
                    A thin layer of acrylic is applied to each toenail. The acrylic is mixed using a liquid monomer and powder polymer, then molded over the nail to create an even, smooth surface. The acrylic is shaped to your desired length and style.
                    <br>
                    Shaping & Filing:
                    <br>
                    After the acrylic has dried, your nails are carefully shaped and filed to the desired length and shape. Common shapes include square, oval, or almond.</p>

                    Long-Lasting Durability:

                    Acrylic nails are highly durable and can last for several weeks without chipping or breaking, making them ideal for those with an active lifestyle or busy schedule.
                    <br>
                    Nail Protection:

                    The acrylic layer protects your natural nails from damage, such as splitting, cracking, or breaking. It’s especially helpful for individuals with weak or brittle toenails.
                    <br>
                    Customization & Design:

                    Acrylic pedicures offer endless possibilities for customization, whether you want a simple color, French tips, or more complex designs like ombre, glitter, or 3D art. You can create unique and stylish looks that suit your personality.
                    <br>
                    Nail Length & Shape:

                    If your toenails are short or damaged, acrylics can add length and help you achieve the desired nail shape and appearance.
                    <br>
                    Resistant to Wear & Tear:

                   Unlike regular nail polish, acrylic nails are highly resistant to chips, smudges, and wear and tear. They remain looking perfect for weeks.</p>

                <p>A Gel Pedicure is a premium pedicure service that uses gel polish to provide a long-lasting, glossy, and durable finish.

                    The feet are soaked in warm, relaxing water to soften the skin and nails. This step helps remove dirt and prepares the nails for the pedicure.

                    Exfoliation:
                    <br>
                    A gentle scrub is applied to exfoliate the feet, removing dead skin cells and rough patches, especially around the heels and toes.
                    <br>
                    Cuticle Care:
                    <br>
                    The cuticles are softened, pushed back, and trimmed to provide a clean base for applying the gel polish. This ensures a smooth, neat appearance around the nail.
                    <br>
                    Nail Shaping:
                    <br>
                    The toenails are trimmed and shaped to your desired style. Common shapes include square, oval, or round.

                    Gel Base Coat:
                    <br>
                    A thin layer of gel base coat is applied to each toenail. This layer helps the gel polish adhere better to the natural nail.

                    Long-Lasting Durability:

                    Gel polish is highly durable and resistant to chips, cracks, and smudges. It can last for 2-3 weeks without losing its shine or vibrancy, making it perfect for those with busy schedules or vacations.

                    Instant Drying:

                    Unlike regular nail polish, gel polish is cured under a UV or LED light, which means there’s no drying time. You can leave the salon with your pedicure completely dry and smudge-free.

                    Chip-Resistant:

                    Gel polish is much more resistant to everyday wear and tear, such as scratching or chipping, which makes it ideal for individuals who want their pedicure to stay perfect for longer.

                    Glossy Finish:

                    Perfect for Special Occasions:

                    Whether you're preparing for a wedding, vacation, or any special event, a gel pedicure ensures that your nails stay looking fresh and beautiful without the need for constant touch-ups.

This type of pedicure is designed to provide a spa-like experience, focusing not only on the appearance of your feet and nails but also on overall relaxation and skin health. It typically includes additional steps, luxurious products, and longer treatment time compared to regular pedicures.</p>

                    Soaking & Foot Scrub:
                    <br>
                    The pedicure begins with a relaxing foot soak in warm water infused with essential oils, bath salts, or fragrant lotions. The soak softens the skin, relieves tension, and prepares your feet for the rest of the treatment. This step is followed by a luxurious exfoliating scrub that helps to remove dead skin, smooth calluses, and reveal softer feet.
                    <br>
                    Foot Mask:
                    <br>
                    After exfoliation, a rich, hydrating foot mask is applied. These masks are often made from ingredients such as honey, coconut, shea butter, or collagen. The mask deeply moisturizes, nourishes, and rejuvenates the skin, providing a glowing and healthy appearance.
                    <br>
                    Cuticle Care:
                    <br>
                    The cuticles are carefully pushed back and trimmed to ensure a clean, neat look around the toenails. This process promotes healthy nail growth and ensures that the nails are properly prepped for polish application.
                    <br>
                    Nail Shaping & Buffing:
                    <br>
                    The toenails are trimmed and shaped according to your preferences, whether you prefer square, oval, or almond-shaped nails. They are then buffed to a smooth, even finish, eliminating any rough edges or imperfections.
                    <br>
                    Luxury Massage:
                    <br>
                    One of the key features of a luxury pedicure is a long, relaxing foot and lower leg massage. Using rich lotions or oils, the massage not only relaxes tired muscles but also helps to improve circulation, reduce swelling, and relieve foot pain. This massage is often combined with hot stones or a warm towel for extra relaxation.</p>
