                    There are various types of nail extensions, including acrylic, gel, polygel, dip powder, and sculpted extensions, each offering unique benefits. Depending on the material and technique, nail extensions can last 2 to 6 weeks with proper care.
                    <br>
                    Extensions come in different shapes (coffin, almond, square, stiletto, oval, round) and can be customized with nail art, glitter, rhinestones, and designs for a unique and glamorous look.

                    Tip Application (Optional): If extra length is needed, nail tips are glued onto the natural nail.
                    <br>
                    Acrylic Mixture Application: A brush is dipped into the liquid monomer and then into the powder polymer to create a bead, which is applied to the nail.
                    <br>
                    Shaping & Drying: The acrylic is sculpted into the desired shape and left to harden naturally.
                    <br>
                    Filing & Polishing: Once hardened, the nails are filed for smoothness and coated with polish or nail art.

                <p>Dip powder nail extensions are a durable and lightweight nail enhancement technique that combines the strength of acrylic with the smooth finish of gel. Instead of using UV light to cure the nails, this method involves dipping the nails into colored powder and sealing it with an activator, making it a healthier and long-lasting option.

                    Dip powder nails are perfect for those who want strong, chip-resistant nails without the heavy feel of acrylics or the curing process of gels.</p>

                    Nail Preparation: The natural nails are cleaned, shaped, and buffed to remove excess oil and improve adhesion.
                    <br>
                    Base Coat Application: A bonding liquid or base coat is applied to help the powder stick.
                    <br>
                    Dipping Process: Nails are dipped into colored acrylic powder or the powder is sprinkled over the nail.
                    <br>
                    Layering: The process is repeated 2-3 times to build up strength and opacity.
                    <br>
                    Activator Application: A special activator liquid is applied to harden the powder and bond it to the nail.
                    <br>
                    Shaping & Buffing: Once hardened, nails are filed and shaped for a smooth finish.
                    <br>
                    Top Coat Application: A final glossy or matte top coat is applied to seal and protect the nails.
