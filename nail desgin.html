                <h3></h3>
                <p>Aura nails are a trendy nail design featuring a soft, airbrushed gradient effect that mimics the look of an energy aura. These nails usually have a glowing, blended color in the center, fading into a different shade towards the edges, creating a mystical and ethereal look.

                  The design is often inspired by spiritual auras, energy fields, and chakra colors, giving the nails a dreamy, otherworldly vibe.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Aura Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    There are two common techniques to create the aura effect:

                    1️⃣ Airbrush Method (Salon-Style)
                    A fine airbrush tool sprays a soft, circular gradient of color onto the nail.
                    Perfect for seamless blending and a true "glowing" aura look.
                    <br>
                    2️⃣ Sponge Method (DIY at Home)
                    A small makeup sponge is dipped in polish and dabbed onto the nail to create a soft, blended effect.
                    Great for those who want to achieve the aura look at home without special tools.

                <p>Jelly nails, also known as glass nails or see-through nails, are a fun and trendy nail style featuring a translucent, glossy, and slightly tinted effect. Inspired by the look of colorful jelly candy, these nails give off a soft, playful, and futuristic vibe.

                    Unlike traditional opaque nail colors, jelly nails have a sheer, see-through finish that can be done in a variety of colors, from pastel pinks and blues to bold neon shades.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Jelly Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    1️⃣ Jelly Gel Polish Method (Easiest & Most Popular)

                    A sheer, tinted gel polish is applied over the nails.
                    Several thin layers are built up to achieve the perfect jelly effect.
                    Finished with a glossy top coat for a shiny, glass-like look.
                    <br>
                    2️⃣ Colored Acrylic Method (Long-Lasting & Stronger Nails)

                     A colored acrylic powder is used instead of polish.
                     Provides a more durable and sculpted jelly nail look.
                    <br>
                    3️⃣ DIY Sheer Polish Hack (For At-Home Nails)

                    Mix clear polish with a drop of colored polish to create a custom jelly shade.
                    Apply in thin coats to get the translucent jelly effect.

                <h3></h3>
                <p>Velvet nails are a luxurious, soft-textured nail trend that creates the illusion of a rich, velvety finish. This unique look is achieved using a magnetic, light-reflecting formula that gives the nails a shimmery, plush appearance, resembling crushed velvet or soft fabric.

                    Unlike traditional matte nails, velvet nails have a dynamic shine that shifts and moves under different lighting, making them one of the most eye-catching and elegant nail styles.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Velvet Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    1️⃣ Cat-Eye Magnetic Gel Method (Most Popular & Long-Lasting)

                    A velvet-effect cat-eye gel polish is applied.
                    A magnet is used to manipulate the reflective particles, creating the soft, velvety illusion.
                    Sealed with a glossy top coat for a smooth and radiant finish.
                    <br>
                    2️⃣ Flocked Velvet Powder Method (Textured, True Fabric Look)

                    A special fine velvet powder (also called flocking powder) is sprinkled over wet gel polish.
                    This creates a fuzzy, 3D texture that feels soft like real fabric.
                    Best for short-term wear as the texture can fade over time.                    
                    <br>
                    <b>Why Are Velvet Nails So Popular?</b>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    ✔ Magical Shine Effect – The color shifts beautifully under light.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Perfect for Any Occasion – Great for winter, holidays, and glamorous events.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Customizable – Works well with ombre, French tips, and nail art accents.

                <p>Comic Book Nails, also known as Cartoon Nails or Pop Art Nails, are a bold and playful nail trend inspired by the hand-drawn, 2D look of comic books and cartoons. This unique style gives the illusion that your nails are straight out of an animated world, with thick black outlines, exaggerated highlights, and vibrant colors that mimic traditional comic illustrations.

                    The goal of Comic Book Nails is to create a flat, animated effect that tricks the eye into seeing your nails as if they were drawn with ink rather than painted with polish.</p>

                    <b>How Are Comic Book Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    1️⃣ Base Color 🎨

                    Choose a bright, solid base color like red, blue, yellow, pink, or green to resemble comic book panels.
                    Pastels or neon shades also work well for a fun, pop-art-inspired look.
                    <br>
                    2️⃣ Bold Black Outlines 🖤

                    A thin nail art brush or black gel polish/liner is used to create thick borders around the edges of the nail.
                    This step gives the nails the signature 2D effect that makes them look like part of a comic strip.
                    <br>
                    3️⃣ White Highlights for Depth ✨

                    Small, strategic white strokes or dots are added to create the illusion of light reflections, just like in animated drawings.
                    This extra detail enhances the cartoon-like appearance.
                    <br>
                    4️⃣ Matte or Glossy Finish 💅

                   For an authentic comic look, a matte top coat is often used to keep the design looking flat and ink-like.
                   However, a glossy finish can also be used for a modern, polished twist.
