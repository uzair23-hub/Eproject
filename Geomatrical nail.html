                <h3></h3>
                <p>Minimalist Geometric Nails are a chic, modern, and subtle nail art style that focuses on clean lines, simple shapes, and negative space to create an elegant yet artistic manicure. Unlike bold or complex nail designs, this style embraces simplicity, symmetry, and precision, making it perfect for those who love a sophisticated, understated look.

                    This nail art usually features thin lines, dots, triangles, squares, or negative space patterns in neutral or soft color palettes. Whether you prefer a sleek black-and-white design, delicate metallic accents, or subtle nude tones, minimalist geometric nails add a touch of sophistication to any look.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Minimalist Geometric Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 1: Choosing the Base 🎨

                     Most designs start with a neutral or nude base coat to enhance the clean aesthetic.
                     Colors like white, beige, soft pink, or transparent polish work well for a subtle foundation
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 2: Adding Geometric Elements ✍

                    Thin lines, dots, triangles, squares, or chevron patterns are painted using a fine nail art brush or striping tape.
                    Designs are often placed on one or two accent nails for a balanced look.
                    Some styles use negative space (unpainted areas) to form modern, airy patterns.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 3: Finishing Touches 💅

                    A matte top coat enhances the sleek, minimalistic effect.
                    A glossy finish can also be used for a more polished, classic look.
                    Small metallic gold or silver accents add a luxurious touch without overpowering the simplicity

                     Most designs start with neutral, pastel, or bold base colors.
                     Matte or glossy finishes can be used, depending on the desired effect.

                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 2: Creating the Geometric Patterns ✍

                    Various lines, circles, triangles, and irregular shapes are drawn using a fine nail art brush or striping tape.
                    Designs can be hand-painted, stamped, or created with stencils for precision.
                    Overlapping shapes and color blocks add depth and movement to the design.

                <h3></h3>
                <p>Color Block Geometric Nails are a bold, modern, and artistic nail trend that combines contrasting color sections with clean geometric shapes. Inspired by the art movement of Piet Mondrian and the bold fashion designs of the 1960s, this nail style creates a sleek, structured, and visually striking look.

                    By dividing the nails into different sections using sharp lines, triangles, squares, and asymmetrical shapes, color block geometric nails make a playful yet sophisticated statement. The use of vibrant, pastel, monochrome, or metallic colors makes this design highly customizable, making it suitable for both minimalists and those who love bold patterns.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Color Block Geometric Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 1: Choosing the Base 🎨

                    A neutral base coat (white, nude, or light gray) helps enhance the color contrast.
                    Some styles skip the base coat and directly apply bold colors.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 2: Creating Geometric Shapes & Blocks ✍

                    Using striping tape, stencils, or freehand nail art brushes, the nail is divided into sections.
                    Sections are painted in different solid colors to create contrast and balance.
                    Some designs feature thin black or metallic outlines for a defined geometric effect.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 3: Adding Extra Details ✨

                    Some designs use negative space, leaving part of the nail unpainted for a modern look.
                    Glossy or matte finishes can be chosen based on the desired effect.
                    Metallic accents (gold or silver) or small graphic elements can enhance the design.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 4: Sealing the Look 💅

                     A high-shine glossy top coat enhances the vibrancy of the colors.
                     A matte top coat gives a trendy, modern, and soft finish.

                <p>Negative Space Geometric Nails are a modern, minimal, and artistic nail design that uses unpainted (bare) sections of the nail to create striking geometric patterns. Instead of covering the entire nail with polish, this design strategically incorporates clear or nude spaces, allowing the natural nail to be part of the design.

                    This nail style often features clean lines, triangles, stripes, and abstract shapes, giving the manicure a chic, futuristic, and elegant look. Negative space designs work well with both bold colors and subtle neutrals, making them a versatile choice for any occasion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>How Are Negative Space Geometric Nails Done?</b>
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 1: Prepping the Base 🎨

                    The nails are cleaned, shaped, and prepped with a clear or nude base coat.
                    Some designs use a sheer pink or light beige base for a soft, natural effect.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 2: Creating the Negative Space Design ✍

                    Striping tape, stencils, or fine brushes are used to section off parts of the nail.
                    Geometric patterns like triangles, diagonal lines, chevrons, and asymmetrical shapes are created.
                    Some nails are left partially unpainted, creating a modern, edgy contrast.
                    <br>
                    ✔ Step 3: Adding Color & Details 🎭

                    Bold colors like black, white, red, or metallic gold enhance the design.
                    Pastel shades can be used for a softer, delicate effect.
                    A matte or glossy top coat is applied to seal the design.
